<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coolant Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Cooled Type</li><li>Water-Cooled Type</li><li>Evaporative Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The coolant chillers market consists of three primary types: air-cooled, water-cooled, and evaporative chillers. Air-cooled chillers utilize ambient air for heat exchange, making them easier to install and maintain but less efficient in high-temperature environments. Water-cooled chillers use water to dissipate heat, offering higher efficiency but requiring a water source and more complex infrastructure. Evaporative chillers combine the benefits of both, using water evaporation for cooling, which can be highly efficient but may require careful management to prevent water wastage and quality issues.</p></p>
